# Test Results - Hugoland Fantasy Adventure Game

## User Problem Statement
The user reported: "When deploying, it says there is an error"

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Issue Identification
- **Problem**: Build was failing with error "Could not resolve entry module './src/components/Skills.tsx'"
- **Root Cause**: The `vite.config.ts` file was referencing a non-existent `Skills.tsx` component in the manual chunks configuration
- **Location**: Line 112 in `/app/vite.config.ts` in the `menu-components` chunk

### 2. Solution Applied
- **Fix**: Removed the reference to `'./src/components/Skills.tsx'` from the manual chunks configuration
- **Code Change**: Updated the `menu-components` chunk to only include existing components:
  ```typescript
  'menu-components': [
    './src/components/HamburgerMenuPage.tsx',
    './src/components/GardenOfGrowth.tsx'
  ]
  ```
